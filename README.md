# Time Series Analysis for Flight Data

This Notebook was done as part of a collaboration between EURECOM and SAFRAN.
SAFRAN provided students with real aeronautical data and introduced how to analyze it in a real industrial condition.


Notebook can be divided into two part:

* The first part is to perform the data cleaning and visualization during which we found out that there was some relation between the time and engine speed N11.

* The second part is then use polynomial model and auto-regressive integrated moving average(ARIMA) to model the engine speed as time series, to predict speed in next time step.
